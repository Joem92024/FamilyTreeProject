
Assumptions:

Families have 2 parents and a collection of children.
Parents can be any gender.
Families parents are not relatives. 
Children can also have their own familes. 
Family trees are based on collections of families 

Tradeoffs:

This solution relies on iterations of collections. Family tree are not trees as defined as a data structure.
The ideal solution is a database and code developed with an ORM.
This solution uses basic vectors for collections.  There are more complex implementatons (graphs -) but not for an example.
The model is not scalable. 
The model rules can not be changed without code changes.
